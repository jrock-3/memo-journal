All right.
 Wasn't able to do any leak code, but I did origami and Dubai thing 12:00. I think that was nice.
 I really was happy about the origami though. I was actually really cool. I might need a pounding. You can see like, how many
 How many individual pieces?
 We're actually.
 instructions saying, but
 I was looking at like a fine friendly.
 You could do.
 More than one time.
 That makes sense like instead of doing them.
 Like five petals.
 He could do four four six. Yeah. And then as well as like he said of doing like three to four in there but I have no problems.
I tried that completely forgot.
 um
 You can.
 Outside I forgot.
 I'm just doing it.
 You know.
 really good stuff
 probably end up doing a pro blocks.
 soon
um,
 I think I'll probably save myself. I think I really need or care for their help.
 so, the ego thing to
 But yeah.
 Let's see.
 The project I think that's cool. I was literally just thinking about how like for this audio that's being processed, I could
 Increase the amount of each guy billing by this.
 Getting rid of all the silent time because, you know, they don't need a process, that requires less compete hours. That's what's going on. I think I saw a way to do that.
To the task for it and then MPEG, it's like a really cool big product like much bigger than I thought in fact like it can pretty much Translate.
 And any audio files or any any media fast or another media file is really cool. Not only that. I think it's like the path or editing.
 Sounds pretty cool. In fact, you're probably create like a editing platform just by doing that, you know.
 I think that's pretty cool project just to try out and explore afternic. Maybe another time or you know, maybe maybe I'll put something just for fun. I think you'd be pretty cool to get a split all that stuff.
 Oh my goodness.
 I got kind of applied here.
Um anything else? Oh Decker did her first day I get to John today or did her first day of the dog.
 I guess this is like a training week slash like
 I forget what they call them. Basically it's like
 It's a trial week where the little sea like. Oh are they compatible as in like just Jennifer like that kind of work and does the fence off this light Jeff?
 so it seemed like it was pretty fulfilling for her pretty tiring, but
 I think that's good, you know.
 I gotta change my time. That's gonna be very interesting. I've never done that one might be used.
 responding to me
 yoga
Yeah, so okay. I kind of really like that idea. So I think I've heard of some YouTubers like they create their own content like managing editing all that stuff Pipeline and I think that's like a really cool thing that I probably want to try. I'm not sure how we'll start but I think it'll be cool right identifying like whatever flow I have, you know in terms of intaking everything. Yeah. I should definitely do something like that.
 Yeah.
 I think if I come over just a breath and that'll be cool.
 And I probably put everything like a dog fight, right?
 Just like in save every transaction in case something happens, right? Okay. I'll make sure the note that down so used.
And the family is so exciting and oh, I really like the origami thing. I think I'll probably have to buy some more or how many paper as well. So, something I'm gonna know this is actually so fun, but yeah. So hopefully, I'll be able to do more. I can easily because like,
 I think it's nice.
 Pattern. Something.
 Yeah.
 Bye. I like going to go over there.
um, so I can keep on going back in circles, but
 Let's see.
 Oh yeah, I don't do the Jennifer website. Forgot about that.
 Okay, improvements. I want to make this. I think right now there's just some, like issues on the front end.
 And then on top of that, I probably want to have like use your specific logins I guess.
 Yeah.
 and then you cannot logging there's something like
 what is it like what do they do? Basically you just have like a username or some sort of key that identifies you identifies it.
and,
 I think that'd be cool.
 You know, something to mount.
 and then,
 Pop around.
 I don't know.
 I think.
 It'd be cool if you like an admin.
 Admin side dashboard.
 says, you're probably put this in like a
 ten little bit.
 Probably.
 Maybe I can use salt hooks, some Reds.
 No. No. I think so close to be cool down. I don't know. How much are we talked? Yes, keep it on the clock right now. I don't really want to see that electricity and Hardware, so that I want to do anything. Well, I'll just leave it there, you know? The baby.
Nothing, nothing too spectacular.
 I should probably also calculate the cost for this kind of stuff. So not only for the Jennifer website but also the
 what's wrong the project that I'm working with transcription project and be sure what cost is specifically using Google Cloud because I want to be able to
 I've heard that it's like a cheaper and I don't think I want to use Azure that seems to interpreting, you know what I mean? No point in switching right now as well, just because the species text, I'm using is awesome. So he's gonna
 eat that kind of Stack, you know, probably have some sort of app front end and then he hits some
 PCP hosting back in. I hope I can write in the rest. I might start off with pine on
and then
 actually, yeah, I'll start off in Python and I'll convert to rest at some point. I really hope that I like actually have motivation to do it. I think I will just because I want to learn rest and just that fact.
 Yeah.
 And then let's see so creating like a timeline or flow or have I have share the family stuff. I think I'll probably have
 what you call it this I guess this has to do with like the Creator automation thing. I'll have to
 create some sort of visualize there. But the audio see if I can get the pin subscription like after you transcribe it basically like Mark each transcription and then I guess I'll see if I can find a way that I can.
 basically
 jump like like search basically for
 How like what parts of the summary things?
Are part of what, you know.
 That's actually pretty cool. Yeah, that's not that basically being able to connect.
 The summary created by a factory BBQ.
 Or GPT for mini, I think. And then discipline like
 Backtracking that to like the section of the audio that considered, you know, I think that's like some cool.
 Or maybe this is like more spamming fence. You just going like hey which part of this is a
 is about wall but that's cool. So they like being able to do that, I feel the double check with the Liberty audience in case I have any problems.
 On top of that if there's like some like invalid part, I probably want some in between.
 Not in between these people like a refresh. So this is not really in terms of saving costs and different like getting married. So I'd be able to like cops sometimes
And like the whole point of this, I'm gonna be able to do the transcription and the summary and sort of like which parts of the ingredients because of that ring, but hey, that's cool.
 So yeah.
 I think.
 What else would I want in terms of like the Audio? I think that's good.
 Probably want some weight to.
 Put it oh, I'm gonna present. Yeah, yeah, the Jennifer project. So being able to
 Being able to.
 Add new ones to the database to the moment side.
 Is right now I'm just keeping as like a list of Secrets and that's like having me I don't. So I'll probably have to change that some short over there, right?
Some sort of database for themselves, etc. Etc, right.
 Or I guess not that would be part of the server side.
 Oh server. Hosting is gonna be a little bitch. But yeah, so I'm gonna give this up this recording process and see see how that goes. Right good good note taking.

Today was quite a mixed bag. I didn’t manage to dive into any LeetCode exercises, but I spent some time doing origami and working on a project related to Dubai at noon, which turned out to be enjoyable. I felt a genuine sense of happiness while practicing origami; it was surprisingly engaging and even a bit challenging. I started to experiment with different designs, contemplating how I could use more or fewer pieces for varied outcomes. I might want to get some more origami paper because it was so fun.

I also brainstormed some ideas for a project involving audio processing. I realized I could optimize audio by removing silent sections, which would likely save processing time and resources. This led me to explore a product that translates media quite efficiently—an extensive tool I hadn’t fully appreciated before. I feel it could allow me to develop an editing platform, which sounds exciting, and I might explore this further.

On a personal note, I saw that Decker had her first day with Jean today. It was a trial week to see if they’d be compatible, and it seemed like a fulfilling experience for her, albeit tiring.

I had some thoughts about creating a content management system, drawing inspiration from YouTubers managing their own video content. This could help streamline my workflow and enhance the entire process of content intake and management. I noted down a few improvements I want to make for the Jennifer website, particularly regarding user logins and frontend issues.

Additionally, I have to calculate costs for both the Jennifer project and the audio transcription project I’m working on. I want to use Google Cloud for its cost-effectiveness over Azure, given the current stack I’m using—no point in making unnecessary changes right now.

Planning to work with Python initially and later transitioning to REST seems like a sensible approach for my projects. I want to document the workflow effectively, perhaps visualizing the process for ease of understanding. I’m thinking about connecting transcriptions generated from audio directly back to their corresponding audio sections for better navigation and summary verification.

Overall, it was a day filled with creativity, introspection, and planning for future projects. I’m hopeful about the directions these ideas might take me, and I’m eager to implement them.

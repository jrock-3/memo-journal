Today was an interesting day, filled with fun moments and some introspection. I spent time with Jennifer, and we worked through the towel spreadsheets while she was super cute and clearly enjoying herself. I was feeling good, especially after drinking some water, which perked me up.

As the day went on, we started dancing together, and I was really enjoying it. I was trying to get into the flow and add my little spin on things. However, I felt like I wasn't fully in sync with her. I noticed that when I attempted to change things up, it seemed to disrupt the flow for her, and that left me feeling a bit alone in the moment. It’s like we were on different wavelengths, which made me sad.

I often try to join in the fun and bring my creativity into our interactions, but I felt dismissed when I tried to express that. There was a clash between my attempts at dance and her expectations, and at one point, her reaction made me doubt myself. She seemed to not really pay attention to my efforts, and that hurt. It reminded me of past experiences where my attempts to contribute were met with critique instead of encouragement.

I realized that I want our moments to feel like a shared experience rather than just following her lead. It often feels like I lack control in our interactions, and that can be frustrating. I want to feel connected, and today’s experience served as a reminder of how easily I can feel pushed out of the moment when my contributions are not well received.

Overall, while I enjoyed spending time with Jennifer and appreciated the attention, I left feeling a bit deflated because I didn’t feel like we were truly connecting. My attempt to add something personal was met with resistance, and that made me feel belittled, as if my input was wrong and hers was right. It’s a recurring theme that frustrates me, and I found it challenging to articulate my feelings to her in a way that she would understand and learn from.

In the end, I just want our time together to feel synchronized and special, and today served as a more poignant reminder of that desire. I’m going to wrap up this recording now.

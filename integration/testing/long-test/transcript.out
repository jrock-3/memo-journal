so
 I started this recording.
 Because I kind of wanted to talk about today.
 so today was pretty fun, you know like
 I was getting more attention from Jennifer we're going through like the towel.
 spreadsheets for the fans going through looking spent she was looking at like
 okay, let me let me let me address. All right. Yeah, we were looking at the the towel family and you're taking a look at everyone you need new is really cute. I can tell you having a lot of fun. I was really feeling it but then I got a drink bunch of water. Like I help I made my feel better.
 And then you just suddenly.
 started
 dancing doing all that stuff. I think it's really fun. Honestly. That was nice. I like
and then
 and then at some point where I was like, you know, you gotta like do like the normal.
 Like the one two three one, two, three and like get it all in like just like that. Right? So I was like trying that.
 But like, you know, we're really doing it and then like, you know, you're taking the lead as usual. That's that's fine. That's some point. I was like, oh, let's try like changing up a little bit but you really notice the change and I think that kind of made me feel a little bit alone.
 It's like, you know.
 you
 The flow state right? So when you're the Flow State it really feels like
 if it feels like
 like
 just like you're really like in the moment, right? I think that's the right put it.
and I was trying to get in the moment and I was trying to like just like feel it out and then like
 I could just kind of tell.
 It wasn't really working out. We try to feel it out, you know.
 It's when I try to like do a little something with the footwork or whatever or change up the hand position.
 You don't really notice or maybe you do and you're like, oh, let's do it back to what I was doing. I don't know whatever it was.
 Like that small little thing. I'm sure you didn't really even notice it but
 the fact that you didn't really
 a little bit sad, I guess I think it hurt.
 very often like
 here don't pay attention to like my little like, you know behaviors or the little quirks, you know, those sort of details right? I want to call it like the social cues in all that stuff, but
 I know you not work.
um, and it's like I was trying to you know, make it not just like oh
 you are
 the doing all the
 Leading and all that stuff, but you know, I want to try to do a little part of it too. Right? Not just follow along because I don't know your moves right so I try to like not bring in my moves, but just like take what the little like I know or maybe think I know and then try to do it.
 At some point you've got mad at me or like you like insulted me a bunch of times.
 For trying to do stuff and like I immediately like didn't want to do stuff and just continue following him.
 I think that's pretty normal.
 in our dynamic
 But I don't know.
 Just Happening while I was really trying to almost enjoying it right that's why I said
 I did kind of enjoy it.
 It's only kind of you really work. Try to steal in the moment and
I reminded why I kind of can't see in the moment.
 I don't know.
 Maybe this is like our chemistry or whatever, you know.
 listening to each other that kind of stuff but it made me a little sad when it was like
 a clash in our wavelengths
 I know we're not always on the same way, right?
 but
 I guess it was just a very bad reminder of other stuff and I like that.
 So it wasn't really able to 100% like enjoy I guess. Yeah, I wasn't able to 100.
 It was very nice. Very fun. I like the attention all that stuff.
 but
 I didn't.
 It wasn't really like.
 our started something and then I guess I have
I I try to start stuff.
 But usually like bad timing, right? Here's a too busy.
 and like
 cuz I can't start stuff, you know, just lets you start stuff.
 And I have no control. I guess that's what you like to do and you like that I can follow but I really like to be able to put myself in.
 let it be our right not just
 not just like
 something that you want to do it together.
 But it didn't it really did not feel like we were doing it together. I don't like it wasn't just you write. It was just because I was falling along. I didn't really feel like
 connected the whole thing. I was just keeping track of your movements.
 and all that stuff
 Yeah.
I think that's it. If I were to summarize why.
 like I guess I had some issues with this moment is because
 I didn't feel like oh I wasn't able to.
 Sorry, we started so to summarize why I sort of.
 Sorry.
 I
 tried to
 put my little spin on it, right? However small but
 it wasn't very well received.
 and that made me
 No, it pushed me out of the moment.
 Okay.
 Which reminded me of something.
 so
 that's the past.
null
all
 when we were
 Trying to do ballroom dancing or whatever. It was to the music earlier.
 I was trying to get in the moment right just like kind of playing around having fun.
 and
 it wasn't really well received by you like
 You said it's like it's the wrong step.
 or
 its
 like
 You told me like, I don't know how to do it, right?
 We'll just kind of mean.
 And I kind of pushed me out of the moment.
 Which is kind of a trigger for me.
 Because the happens a lot.
 Where you say something that you think is sort of innocent innocuous.
Are and you realize?
 And that made me a little bit.
 Sad, I guess it's soured. What should have been like a really really sweet moment right where we're just doing our own little thing.
 growing our time
 just being together.
 Our own little thing.
 Doesn't have to be perfect. It's ours. That's what makes it. Perfect.
 but when I try to make it hours
 it kind of fail like it got rejected.
 That made me sad, right?
 because just yeah another reminder like
 oh Jennifer doesn't really
 Pay attention to this kind of stuff that's important to me.
like trying out little thing, or maybe it's
 she reacts really poorly.
 when I do stuff
 I don't know trying to trying to phrase it in a way that if I told Jennifer she'd actually get it and learn something from it.
 I don't even know.
 It was just for being harsh.
 I don't know shit.
 It's okay. I can teach you like my sister. She didn't know she either.
 Right when Jennifer say that makes you feel stupid.
 like the way that she reacted to me, that's kind of like
 made me feel.
 like
 what I was doing was wrong.
 And what she's doing is right.
No.
 frustrating
 because that happens all the time.
 Yeah.
 I guess I hate it when Jennifer really shoves like
 I'm right you're wrong to my throat.
 It makes me feel.
 belittled, right
 Yeah.
 I don't know how to say I think.
 I think that's the best thing I can say. All right, I'm gonna end this recording.

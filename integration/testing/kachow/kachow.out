June 28th, Wednesday morning, 2:40 a.m. 

I just finished a long call, and I'm still processing everything. I talked to Jennifer, and it felt incredible to unload all my worries onto her. She is truly amazing, taking everything in stride and helping me see things more clearly. The biggest lesson I took away from our conversation is captured perfectly in today’s quote: "She is giving you 30 things to worry about, so why are you?" This really resonates with me. 

A lot of my anxiety comes from my own expectations and past experiences with how others have reacted. But Jennifer hasn’t given me any reasons to doubt; in fact, she’s provided plenty of reassurance. It's liberating to realize that. 

I feel fortunate to have a girlfriend who loves me and alleviates my concerns. I shouldn't be stressing over trivial things, like whether she's upset about something minor. Ronnie mentioned that I’d be able to tell if she were uncomfortable, so I need to work on being more at ease with these conversations.

The last few days have been quite stressful for me, trying to balance all these thoughts in my head, but after our chat tonight, I feel like a weight has been lifted. It’s such a relief to share burdens with someone who truly supports me through it all. 

Jennifer understands me on a level that’s hard to describe—she's so self-aware, caring, and, to top it all off, we share the same values. We're going through similar experiences which helps us connect deeply. I can recognize all the green flags, and I’m grateful to have found someone like her. 

In summary, I feel incredibly lucky to have met someone like Jennifer. Our communication has been so refreshing, and it seems like everything is falling into place. Here’s to finding more reasons to be happy. Good night!

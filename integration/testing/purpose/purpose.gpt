Today, I found myself grappling with a lot of introspective thoughts. I realized I need some sort of purpose in my life, but it’s hard for me to do things just for myself. I keep questioning why I want to leave home when I have everything I could possibly want. It feels like I’m just distracting myself, and when things calm down, these feelings will still be present.

I acknowledged my privilege yet still feel incomplete. I messed up by yelling at my girlfriend the other night, which is weighing on me. I want to be more purposeful and do something meaningful with my life, but sometimes I just want to sit back and reflect.

I have this urge to dig deeper into my family's history—understand where we came from and the stories that shape us. I feel like connecting with my roots might help me find that purpose I’m searching for. But the idea of reaching out to my family feels daunting.

I want to document my journey and the experiences that have shaped me. I recognize that I’m good at collecting ideas but struggle to keep them. This realization led me to think that maybe I should start summarizing my thoughts as a way to understand myself better.

Before jumping into new projects, I need to organize my thoughts first. I believe that reflecting on my experiences can help me build tools for my purpose. So, I’ve decided to start this process of summarizing my thoughts and exploring my family's stories.

It feels like a step in the right direction, and I’m motivated to see where this will take me. Here’s to embracing this journey! Signing off for now.

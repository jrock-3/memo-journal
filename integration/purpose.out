All right. I don't know what happened to that last recording.
 but
 whatever it is.
 you just feel like
 oh, no, I need some sort of fucking purpose, you know.
 It's so hard to do things for myself.
 like
 what I even want to leak out.
 Because it's good for me. Why is it good for me?
 And you find meaning in these things.
 I just want like I don't want to think too hard about these things. I just want to like do it because because I want to do it.
 You know, it should be simple, right?
 and like
 I don't know. Maybe this is just because I have too much time on my hands.
 Like but I feel like if I'm just distracting myself. It just means that when things calm down. I'm just gonna feel this way.
You know, like I'm so privileged to have all these things that I want.
 in life
 yet somehow
 you are somehow I don't feel like I have
 I can't asking for everything, you know, not perfect either.
 It's literally just yelling at my girlfriend the other night.
 That's terrible.
 I'm coming down just because I'm talking about it, but
 Like what can I do?
 What can I do?
 to make myself
 be purposeful.
 Like want to do something with my life.
 feel like
 I feel like I don't know.
 feel like
 I feel like I just want to like sit down.
I don't want to learn.
 Learn about where I came from.
 That sounds fun.
 I kind of want to document that I want to.
 I want to tell my family story tell.
 figure out
 why?
 Why these things happen?
 Or what even happened?
 Where we came from?
 What's good about it? Well, it's not.
 Good bad ugly, so I want to know it all.
 I feel like I don't really know the stories. I don't know where I came from.
 I feel like if I look back maybe I'll find purpose.
 Maybe they all just starts right there.
 Why not, you know?
 but
 I should try something, right?
like, let's see what
 Let's see what my family's doing today.
 bombs
 mom, so home
 looks like you know.
 Okay.
 On is also home.
 Jocelyn is let me guess she's out.
 Oh wait.
 Yum.
 Okay. Yeah. Oh maybe I should just figure out who I am, you know to figure out who I am. I need to look back.
 I guess I'm just scared to reach out.
Good. Yeah.
 But I want to know my story.
 I don't know everyone's story.
 I don't know why things happened why things didn't happen.
 on record it
 feel like
 if I just exist without a history then
 what is that meant to be you know?
 I feel like I'm good at collecting ideas. I'm just not gonna keeping them.
 Maybe that's what I should.
 do I think was important thing I should
I feel like
 any of build tools that I might to serve my purpose, you know.
 and if a tool like summarizing
 my thoughts
 is something that's going to help me which I think it will.
 Then I think I should work on it.
 Why not?
 Because the worst thing to do is context switch, right?
 and
 I'll have to contacts which one I do this.
 but
 before I can do that, I gotta fix this stuff.
 So because me some motivation.
 I think that's nice.
 All right.
 Let's do it.
I like that.
 All right.
 I'm gonna go ahead and do that then signing off.
